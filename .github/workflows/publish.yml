# GitHub Actions workflow: Publish packages to npm
#
# Two ways to trigger:
#
# A) **Automated via Changesets (recommended)**
#    Push to main with changeset files → opens a "Version Packages" PR.
#    Merge that PR → versions are bumped, CHANGELOG updated, and packages
#    are published to npm automatically.
#
# B) **Manual dispatch**
#    Go to Actions → "Publish" → "Run workflow" to publish immediately.
